The Buffee Accelerator Project is the brainchild of Renee Cousins and Tim Wacker; started in the fall of 2019, it was originally conceived as the ultimate 68000 accelerator to actually deliver on the promises made by the Vampire accelerator released a few years ago. Disappointed by it's direction and lack of any performance improvments, we named the project "Buffy" for obvious reasons. This was recently renamed to Buffee to avoid any intellectual property disputes; but we'll do our best to keep our tongues firmly in-cheek.

### Support Us

Right now, this project being done because we love the Amiga community and believe that we could use a really awesome 68000 accelerator. Absolutely everything from the hardware, to the firmware and eventually to the software will be open source. While we will eventually do a retail launch, we could use your support in the meantime. We're making it very easy to help fund us through PayPal or Buy me a Coffee. We hope to enable GitHub sponsorship soon as well.
