The Buffee Accelerator Project is the brainchild of Renee Cousins and Tim Wacker; started in the fall of 2019, it was originally conceived as the ultimate 68000 accelerator to actually deliver on the promises made by the Vampire accelerator released a few years ago. Disappointed by it's direction and lack of any performance improvments, we named the project "Buffy" for obvious reasons. This was recently renamed to Buffee to avoid any intellectual property disputes; but we'll do our best to keep our tongues firmly in-cheek.
